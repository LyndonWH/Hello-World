Guide to Petworth and it's points of interest
I'm a Petworth native. I'm a 50ish African American male. I work in IT/Telecom. I'm single. One teenage boy child. I really love living in Petworth. There's a lot of history and new amenities in the community. Lots of new people in the neighborhood as well.
